# Private Cloud

## Monitoring

Once the private cloud is created, a GCE VM instance will be created where the observability agent is installed to retrieve VMWare metrics and logs into GCP. 
The monitoring setup approach will include:
- enable monitoring API on the project
- creating a new GCE VM instance
- creating a new service account with monitoring & logging permissions
- installing the GCVE observability agent in the GCE VM
- ability to create new GCVE dashboards
