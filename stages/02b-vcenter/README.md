# vCenter Stage

## Use Cases

In this stage vCenter will be configured with a folder hierarchy, resource pools and permissions.

Use the `terraform.tfvar.example` file as a template to populate the variables to deploy a folder and resource pool hierarchy.

If a nested hierarchy of folders should be deployed, deploy the folder module for each hierarchy sequentially with the `depends_on` meta-argument.

## Prerequisites

 * Private Cloud is already deployed and accessible
 * Roles and identities which are assigned to resource pools and folders need to exist before executing this stage

## Dependencies

 * modules/vcenter-resource-pool
 * modules/vcenter-folder
